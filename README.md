## Introduction
For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and 
organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, 
democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of 
these words to return documents that contain another word in the set.

The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related 
forms of a word to a common base form. Stemming follows a heuristic approach to reducing the stem wherein the 
stemmer word will have similar character strings and may or may not be a valid dictionary word e.g.

```txt
happy --> happi
running --> run
```

The lemmatizer on the other hand doesn't follow a heuristic approach in reducing the word and will instead 
use a lookup table to refer to the various forms and meanings the word can possess and will also look up the 
surrounding context of the word to determine the correct POS (Part of Speech) Tag, which is then used to find the
__lexeme__ of the word. The lexeme is a valid english word and doesn't necessarily have to have a similar chracter
(root) structure e.g.

```txt
better --> good
wolves --> wolf
```  

We implement the lemmitizer using the Python __nltl__ package and apply it on a resume and compare the output with a
stemmed form of the same resume. Further Analytics and discussion give a deep dive into advantages, disadvantages and 
uses cases of lemmitization.

## Implementation
The following Helper classes have been used to create the stemmed output, lemmatize and 
Tokenize the output.

- [PorterStemmer](src/PorterStemmer.py)
- [Lemmatizer](src/Lemmatizer.py)
- [Tokenizer](src/Tokenizer.py)

> _Tokenizer_ uses the __nltk.RegexpTokenizer__

> _Lemmatizer_ uses the __nltk.WordNetLemmatizer__

> _PorterStemmer_ has been implemented by 
> [@anishLearnsToCode](https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode). 
> See project [here](https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/porter-stemmer).
 
Initially the resume is loaded as a string from the `assets/resume.txt` file. 2 outputs are 
created from this resume. One stemmed, one lemmatized. Both these outputs are compared and 
basic analysis is run on them in the `src/analytics.py` file.

## Analytics & Discussion
Stemming reduces words having the same chacater roots (may not have same meanings) to the same roots and this is 
then helpful in IR (Information Retrieval) Applications as the person/user can search for small strings like uni or 
univer and these strings will automatically match to university , universities etc.

So, stemming makes a lot of sense in Information Retrieval Applications. In advanced information retrieval 
applications where the user can not only enter a stemmed form of what she is searching, but can also enter the 
context of what she wishes to search such as better food than x (where x is a restaurant). Our IR application should 
be abe to understand that better here refers to good food or better ratings than the ratings for a restaurant.

Or we may have a chatbot application which communicates with the user and the chatbot application needs to 
understand the intent of the user so that the chatbot can answer queries that the user puts forth. For answering 
queries or understanding speech and translating to text, or calculating the probability of given word we require a 
model that can understand context and not just the root of a word.

In such applications we use lemmatization along with POS (Part of Speech) tagging. Even in machine translations 
wherein we need to compute the probabilities of the translated text, we need a lemmatizer along with a POS tagger 
to compute structure and probabilities.

Hence, both the stemmer and the lemmatizer cater to very different needs. In our application we decide whether to use 
a stemmer or lemmatizer based on what our application must do. In a system with multiple resumes, the most common 
thing an employer might want to do is search the corpora with specific skills such as management , java , 
machine learning etc. and then receive resumes with a match for this string.

Hence, in our application which is centered more around Information Extraction/Information Retrieval than context 
understanding Stemming makes more sense. This may seem counter intuitive as we have seen in the analytics above that 
lemmatization preserves the POS tags and context structure, but preserving POS tags and context structure will not 
improve an IR system.

## Running Project Locally
Clone the repository on your machine and enter the project directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/lemmatization.git
cd lemmatization
cd src
```

Load in the Resume and create a stemmed and lemmatized output 
```bash
python stem_resume.py
python lemmatize_resume.py
```

See the outputs of the original, stemmed and lemmatized resumes: 
```bash
python output_resume.py
python output_setmmed.py
python output_lemmatized.py
```

Run the Analytics on the Stemmed and Lemmatized outputs
```bash
python analytics.py
```
